## OVERVIEW: 
The Fake News Detection project is a web application aimed at identifying and classifying news articles as real or fake. 

By analyzing the textual content of news articles, the app uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect misleading or false information, thereby assisting users in discerning the credibility of news sources.

---

## Key Features:
- **Text Input:** Allows users to input news article text for analysis.
- **Prediction Model:** Applies a trained NLP model to classify the input text as real or fake news.
- **Result Display:** Shows the classification result to the user, indicating the likelihood of the news being fake.
