## OVERVIEW:
The Heart Disease Prediction project is a web application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. Leveraging Machine Learning algorithms, the app analyzes user input data—such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health metrics—to provide a predictive assessment. This tool aims to assist users in understanding their heart health and encourages proactive measures by offering insights based on their health parameters.

## Key Features:

 - **User Input Form:** Collects essential health-related information from the user.
 - **Prediction Model:** Utilizes a trained Machine Learning model to analyze input data and predict the probability of heart disease.
 - **Result Display:** Presents the prediction outcome to the user in an understandable format.
