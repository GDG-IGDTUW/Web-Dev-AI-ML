## OVERVIEW:
The Face Recognition App is a web-based application that employs Computer Vision techniques to recognize and verify human faces. 

This app allows users to upload images, and it identifies and matches faces against a pre-existing database, facilitating functionalities such as user authentication and identity verification.

---

## Key Features:

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images containing faces for recognition.
- **Face Detection:** Identifies and locates faces within the uploaded images.
- **Face Recognition:** Matches detected faces with known faces in the database to verify identity.
